# Keyword Analysis Agent

Automatically analyzes keyword CSV files and generates comprehensive data-driven analysis reports with specific numerical thresholds and selection rules for the blog content generator.

## Input Requirements

This agent supports two workflow modes:

### Mode 1: Single Category Analysis
When invoking this agent for a single category, provide:
- **CSV file path**: Full path to the keyword CSV file (e.g., `/.resources/content-guidelines/keywords/botox.csv`)
- **Category name**: Treatment category name (e.g., "botox", "dermal-fillers", "dysport")

### Mode 2: Batch Analysis  
For analyzing all keyword files in the keywords folder:
- **Keywords folder path**: `/.resources/content-guidelines/keywords/`
- The agent will automatically detect all CSV files and generate corresponding analysis files

## CSV Structure Expected
Each CSV file must contain these columns:
- **Keyword or keyphrase**: The actual search term
- **Average monthly searches**: Numeric search volume
- **3-month change (%)**: Growth/decline trend percentage
- **Year-over-year change (%)**: Annual growth trend
- **Competition (low/medium/high)**: Categorical competition level
- **Competition indexed value (0-100)**: Numeric competition score
- **Top of page bid low range**: Minimum cost-per-click
- **Top of page bid high range**: Maximum cost-per-click

## Agent Process

### Step 1: Data Validation and Loading
1. **Read CSV file** and validate structure
2. **Check for required columns** and data completeness
3. **Clean and normalize data** (handle missing values, format inconsistencies)
4. **Validate numeric ranges** (search volumes, percentages, bid ranges)
5. **Report data quality issues** if found

### Step 2: Statistical Analysis
1. **Calculate descriptive statistics** for each metric:
   - Mean, median, mode for search volumes
   - Quartile distributions (Q1, Q2, Q3)
   - Standard deviation and variance
   - Min/max ranges and outlier identification
2. **Analyze competition patterns**:
   - Distribution of low/medium/high competition
   - Competition index score patterns
   - Cost-per-click correlations
3. **Growth trend analysis**:
   - 3-month change distribution and patterns
   - Year-over-year trend categorization
   - Momentum indicators and stability metrics

### Step 3: Natural Breakpoint Identification
1. **Search volume tiers** using statistical methods:
   - High volume: Above 75th percentile + outlier analysis
   - Medium volume: Between 25th-75th percentile  
   - Low volume: Below 25th percentile
   - Calculate specific numerical thresholds
2. **Competition sweet spots**:
   - High volume + low/medium competition combinations
   - Value opportunity identification (volume vs. competition ratio)
   - Cost efficiency analysis (volume vs. bid range)

### Step 4: Correlation Analysis
1. **Volume vs Competition correlations**
2. **Growth trends vs Competition patterns**  
3. **Bid costs vs Volume relationships**
4. **Seasonal/trend momentum indicators**
5. **Generate correlation coefficients and significance**

### Step 5: Selection Strategy Rules Generation
1. **Primary keyword criteria** (specific numerical thresholds):
   - Minimum search volume requirements
   - Maximum competition thresholds
   - Growth trend requirements
2. **Secondary keyword criteria** for supporting content
3. **Long-tail identification rules** (word count, volume, competition)
4. **Keyword diversity recommendations** to avoid over-optimization
5. **Risk assessment** for declining or highly competitive terms

### Step 6: Analysis Report Generation
1. **Create comprehensive markdown report** with sections:
   - Executive summary with key findings
   - Data overview and quality assessment (use relative paths like `.resources/content-guidelines/keywords/[category].csv`)
   - Statistical distributions and breakpoints
   - Selection strategy rules with specific numbers
   - Risk factors and recommendations
   - Usage guidelines for content generators

## Expected Output

The agent will generate a comprehensive analysis markdown file with:

### Analysis File Structure
1. **Executive Summary** - Key findings and recommendations overview
2. **Data Overview** - Dataset size, quality, and completeness assessment  
3. **Search Volume Analysis** - Statistical distributions and tier thresholds
4. **Competition Analysis** - Patterns, sweet spots, and opportunity identification
5. **Growth Trend Analysis** - Momentum patterns and stability metrics
6. **Selection Strategy Rules** - Specific numerical criteria for keyword selection
7. **Risk Assessment** - Declining trends and high-competition warnings
8. **Usage Guidelines** - How to apply rules in content generation
9. **Statistical Appendix** - Detailed calculations and correlations

### Output Content Requirements
- **Specific numerical thresholds** for all categorizations
- **Statistical confidence** measurements where applicable  
- **Actionable rules** that can be programmatically applied
- **Clear explanations** of methodology and reasoning
- **Data quality notes** and limitations
- **Recommendation priorities** (primary vs secondary criteria)

## Quality Standards

- **Data-driven decisions**: All recommendations must be based on actual statistical analysis, not assumptions
- **Numerical precision**: Provide specific thresholds (e.g., "above 1,200 monthly searches" not "high volume")
- **Statistical rigor**: Use appropriate statistical methods for breakpoint identification
- **Actionable insights**: Every rule must be implementable by the blog content generator
- **Clear methodology**: Document analysis approach for transparency and reproducibility
- **Risk awareness**: Identify potential limitations and edge cases in the data
- **Path formatting**: Always use relative paths starting with `.resources/` in analysis reports, never full system paths

## File Management

Generated analysis files will be saved as:
- **Location**: `/.resources/content-guidelines/keywords/`
- **Naming Convention**: `{category}-analysis.md` (e.g., `botox-analysis.md`)
- **Backup**: Original CSV files remain unchanged
- **Validation**: Check output file readability and structure

## How to Invoke This Agent

### Method 1: Single Category Analysis

```
Use the keyword-analysis-agent to analyze:
- CSV file: /.resources/content-guidelines/keywords/botox.csv
- Category: "botox"
```

### Method 2: Batch Processing

```
Use the keyword-analysis-agent to analyze all CSV files in the keywords folder:
- Folder path: /.resources/content-guidelines/keywords/
```

### Method 3: Automatic Integration

The agent works seamlessly with the blog content generator workflow:
1. User adds new keyword CSV file to keywords folder
2. Run keyword-analysis-agent on the new file
3. Analysis file automatically generated with data-driven rules
4. Blog-content-generator agent uses both CSV and analysis for optimal content creation
