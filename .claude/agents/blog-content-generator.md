# Blog Content Generator Agent

Generate comprehensive, SEO-optimized blog posts for Still Time Beauty with integrated keyword research and local geographic differentiation.

## Input Requirements

This agent supports two workflow modes:

### Mode 1: Single Post Generation
When invoking this agent for a single post, provide:
- **Primary topic/keyword**: Main focus for the blog post (can be just a keyword/phrase or a complete predefined title)
- **Category**: Hugo website category (Botox, Dermal Fillers, Dysport, Treatment Comparisons, etc.) - determines how content is categorized on the site
- **Keyword Sources**: Which analysis files to use for keyword research (e.g., "Botox" or "Botox, Dysport") - determines which CSV/analysis files to read
- **Content length**: Not required - agent defaults to brief, helpful content (maximum 1,200 words)
- **Geographic location** (optional): Specific city (Boulder, Superior, Louisville, etc.) for location-based content - maps to `location` field in front matter
- **Local strategy** (optional): "full-local" (entire article localized), "faq-local" (generic article + local FAQ section), or "generic" (no location focus)
  - **Dependency**: "full-local" and "faq-local" require geographic location to be provided
  - **Default**: "faq-local" when location provided, "generic" when no location
  - **Override**: Can specify "generic" even with location provided for universal content
- **H1 title** (optional): If provided, use this exact H1; otherwise generate from keyword/topic (typically matches or closely aligns with title)

**Field Distinction:**
- **Category**: Website organization (appears in Hugo front matter categories)
- **Keyword Sources**: Keyword research data sources (determines which analysis.md files to read)
- **Example**: Category "Treatment Comparisons" + Keyword Sources "Botox, Dysport" = comparison post filed under Treatment Comparisons using both keyword datasets

### Mode 2: Batch Processing
For multiple posts, provide:
- **Content queue file path**: Path to markdown file containing multiple post definitions (see `/.resources/content-guidelines/content-queue-template.md` for format)

The agent will process all posts in the queue file sequentially and generate individual blog post files for each.


## Agent Process

### Step 1: Create Working Data File
1. **Create temporary working file** to capture all research and data collection:
   - **File location**: `/.resources/content-guidelines/blog-content/[article-name]-DATA.md`
   - **File naming**: Same as the article filename but with "-DATA" suffix in capital letters (e.g., if article is `botox-for-migraine-relief.md`, working file is `botox-for-migraine-relief-DATA.md`)
2. **Populate working file sections** (for complete self-sufficiency in regeneration):
   - **Article Parameters**: Primary topic, category, keyword sources, content length, geographic location, local strategy
   - **Raw CSV Data**: Complete keyword dataset that was analyzed (with volumes, competition, trends)
   - **Analysis Rules Applied**: Specific thresholds and criteria used from analysis.md files
   - **Selected Keywords**: Chosen primary and supporting keywords with selection rationale
   - **Keyword Selection Logic**: Why each keyword was chosen (volume tier, competition sweet spot, etc.)
   - **Generated Title & Description**: SEO-optimized title and meta description for consistency
   - **Complete Front Matter**: Full Hugo front matter structure ready for use
   - **Geographic Strategy**: Specific local strategy used (full-local/faq-local/generic) and implementation approach
   - **City Data**: Local references, landmarks, demographics (if applicable)
   - **Content Outline**: Planned H2/H3 sections with specific topics and local integration points
   - **FAQ Content**: Complete questions and answers for front matter schema (not article body)
   - **References Found**: URLs and publication names collected via WebSearch
   - **Content Angles**: Specific approaches, unique perspectives, and differentiation strategy
   - **Internal Linking Opportunities**: Identified potential internal links for later enhancement
3. **Use working file as single source** for article generation - no need to re-query CSV or analysis files
4. **Retain working file** after article completion for future revisions or updates
5. **Complete self-sufficiency**: DATA file must contain everything needed to regenerate the article without external lookups
6. **Comprehensive capture**: Save ALL research, decisions, and data - err on the side of including too much rather than too little

### Step 2: Keyword Research Integration (Data-Driven Approach)
1. **Read keyword data** from `/.resources/content-guidelines/keywords/[keyword-source].csv` (e.g., botox.csv, dermal-fillers.csv)
   - **Important**: Use the **Keyword Sources** field to determine CSV filename(s), NOT the primary topic or category
   - **Example**: Topic "best time for Botox" + Keyword Sources "Botox" → reads `botox.csv`
   - **For multiple sources**: Keyword Sources "Botox, Dysport" → reads both `botox.csv` AND `dysport.csv`
2. **Read analysis rules** from `/.resources/content-guidelines/keywords/analysis/[keyword-source]-analysis.md` (generated by Keyword Strategy Agent's internal Analysis Agent)
   - **Important**: Use the **Keyword Sources** field to determine analysis filename(s), NOT the primary topic or category
   - **Example**: Topic "best time for Botox" + Keyword Sources "Botox" → reads `analysis/botox-analysis.md`
   - **For multiple sources**: Keyword Sources "Botox, Dysport" → reads both `analysis/botox-analysis.md` AND `analysis/dysport-analysis.md`
   - **Error handling**: If any required analysis.md file is missing, stop process and display error: "Missing analysis file for keyword source '[source]'. Please run the Keyword Strategy Agent on [source].csv first."
3. **Apply data-driven selection strategy** using analysis file criteria:
   - Use statistical thresholds and competition sweet spots from analysis file(s) to categorize keywords
   - Apply growth trend categorization with specific numerical ranges from analysis
   - Follow volume vs competition correlations identified in analysis
   - **For comparison posts**: Balance keyword selection between all categories (e.g., select keywords from both Botox AND Dysport analysis rules)
4. **Apply hybrid keyword selection strategy** with analysis-driven tiers:
   - Group keywords into semantic clusters (avoid selecting multiple variations of same concept)
   - Tier keywords using analysis file breakpoints: **high-volume (1-2 selections)** + **mid-volume (2-3 selections)** + **long-tail (1-2 selections)**
   - **For comparison posts**: Distribute selections across categories (e.g., 1 Botox high-volume + 1 Dysport high-volume)
   - Apply light randomization within each tier for natural variation
   - Check against recent usage to prevent repetitive keyword patterns
5. **Generate geographic variations** if location specified
6. **Ensure balanced SEO approach** (not over-optimization) with diverse content angles
7. **Document in working file**: Add selected keywords with search volumes and analysis rules applied

### Step 3: Local Data Integration (Location-Dependent)
**Apply based on local-strategy parameter:**

#### Full-Local Strategy (`"full-local"`):
1. **Check for city data** in `/.resources/content-guidelines/cities/[cityname].md`
2. **Extract unique local references** for content differentiation throughout article
3. **Identify specific landmarks, activities, demographics** for authentic local connection
4. **Plan content angles** that distinguish this post from similar topics in other locations
5. **Integrate location throughout**: Headlines, content sections, and examples
6. **Document in working file**: Add comprehensive city data and local references

#### FAQ-Local Strategy (`"faq-local"` - Default when location provided):
1. **Keep main content generic** - focus on universal topic coverage
2. **Check for city data** in `/.resources/content-guidelines/cities/[cityname].md` for FAQ section and incorporate relevant local details into FAQ answers
3. **Plan location-specific FAQs** such as:
   - **Location Questions** - Use varied phrasing: 
      "Where can I get [treatment] **near** [location]?", 
      "Are there [treatment] specialists **close to** [location]?", 
      "Where can I find [treatment] in the **[location] area**?", 
      "Are there [treatment] providers **serving** [location]?", 
      "Where can I get [treatment] **around** [location]?"
   - **Honest Boulder Location Answers** - For surrounding towns (Superior, Louisville, Lafayette, Westminster, etc.), always mention Boulder as the actual service location with drive time and incorporate city data details: 
      "[Location], [state] residents can access [treatment] at Still Time Beauty in nearby Boulder - just a 15-20 minute drive..." or 
      "Yes, Still Time Beauty in Boulder serves [location], [state] and surrounding communities..." 
   - **Business Value Questions** - Use varied phrasing: 
      "Why choose [business] for [service] in [location]?", 
      "What makes [business] the best [service] provider in [location]?", 
      "Which is the best [service] provider in [location]?",
      "Top reasons to choose [business] for [service]", 
      "What should I expect from [service] at [business]?", 
      "How does [business] ensure quality [service] results?", 
      "Why do patients recommend [business] for [service]?"
   - **State Context**: For ambiguous city names (Superior, Louisville, Lafayette, Westminster), always include "Colorado" or "CO" in FAQ answers for clarity
4. **Document in working file**: Add local FAQ questions and city-specific answers
5. **Combine FAQ types**: Mix universal topic FAQs with location-specific FAQs (4-6 general + 2-3 local FAQs)

#### Generic Strategy (`"generic"`):
1. **Skip location integration** - focus purely on topic expertise
2. **No city data required** - universal content approach
3. **Automatic fallback** when no geographic location provided
4. **Document in working file**: Note generic approach for consistency

### Step 4: Content Structure Generation (Conversational Q&A Format)
1. **Reference working data file** as primary source for all content generation:
   - Use selected keywords from working file (not CSV files)
   - Use planned content outline from working file
   - Use prepared FAQ content from working file for front matter schema
   - Use found references from working file
2. **Create Hugo-compliant front matter** with required fields:
   - `title`: Use provided title if given, otherwise generate SEO-optimized title using primary keyword and location (if applicable)
   - `description`: 150-160 characters for search results, incorporating primary keyword naturally
   - `keywords`: YAML array format with quoted strings (e.g., `- "keyword phrase"`) using selected keywords from working file
   - `author`: "Still Time Beauty"
   - `date`: Content creation date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - `publishDate`: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - `type`: "blog"
   - `categories`: Array with specified category (e.g., ["Botox"])
   - `location`: Geographic location if provided (e.g., "Boulder", "Superior")
   - `params.h1title`: Optional cleaner H1 override
   - `faqs`: 3-6 Q&A pairs for structured data schema (combine universal topic FAQs with location-specific FAQs based on local-strategy)
   - `references`: 3-5 credible sources with name and URL fields for build-time rendering
3. **Structure content using conversational, natural H2 titles** in article format:
   - **No H1 in content body**: Hugo generates H1 from front matter `h1title` parameter - start content directly with opening paragraph
   - **Opening paragraph**: Provide clear answer that serves as TLDR for the whole article, incorporating the main topic naturally
     - Example: Start with "Botox side effects are typically mild and temporary..." rather than "# How to Manage Botox Side Effects"
   - **H2 sections**: Use natural, conversational titles - mix questions and statements based on what flows best
     - **Question format**: "How Long Does Botox Last?", "What Botox Side Effects Should I Expect?", "When Should I Worry About Side Effects?"
     - **Statement format**: "Botox Side Effects to Expect", "Best Candidates for Botox Treatment", "Botox vs Dysport Comparison"
     - **Mix it up**: Vary between questions and statements throughout the article for natural flow
     - **Avoid colons**: Don't use formal titles like "Botox Side Effects: What to Expect" - keep titles conversational and flowing
     - **Choose what sounds most natural**: Let the content and topic guide whether a question or statement works better for each section
   - **Answer each question directly** in conversational tone focusing on what readers need to know
   - **Focus on the specific topic only** - avoid unrelated sections like cost/provider selection unless directly relevant to the main question
   - **Keep sections brief and specific** - address the question asked, not exhaustive background information
4. **Use strategic formatting to break up content**:
   - **Bold text** for key timeframes, important points, and emphasis
   - **Bullet points** for practical tips, step-by-step instructions, warning signs, and actionable items
   - **Blockquotes (>)** for key takeaways, important warnings, or memorable points
   - **Structured lists** with clear categories when helpful (e.g., "First 24 Hours:", "Week 1:", "Warning Signs:")
   - **Avoid walls of text** - mix paragraphs with formatting elements for scannable content
5. **Plan strategic internal links** (2-3 links with proper ARIA labels) when genuinely helpful
6. **FAQ handling**: FAQs are automatically generated at build time from front matter schema - do NOT create FAQ content section in article body

### Step 5: SEO Optimization
1. **H1 handled by front matter**: Hugo generates H1 from `h1title` parameter - integrate primary keyword naturally in opening paragraph
2. **Distribute supporting keywords** naturally throughout content
3. **Apply geographic optimization based on local-strategy**:
   - **Full-local**: Add geographic modifiers throughout content for local SEO, include state for ambiguous city names
   - **FAQ-local**: Keep main content generic, add location keywords only in FAQ section with state context in answers
   - **Generic**: No geographic modifiers
4. **Include semantic keyword variations** for comprehensive coverage
5. **Balance keyword density** at 1-2% (reasonable SEO approach)

### Step 6: Content Focus (Strategy-Dependent)
**Apply based on local-strategy parameter:**

#### Full-Local Strategy:
1. **Focus on being helpful** with city-specific context throughout content
2. **Incorporate local details** when they genuinely help answer the question
3. **Use local examples** based on demographics or lifestyle when relevant
4. **Ensure authentic local connection** without forcing unnecessary geographic references

#### FAQ-Local Strategy:
1. **Focus on answering questions helpfully** for main content
2. **Add local context only in FAQ section** with city-specific questions/answers
3. **Keep main content universally valuable** and directly helpful
4. **Ensure local FAQs provide genuine value** to location-specific questions

#### Generic Strategy:
1. **Focus purely on being helpful** and answering questions directly
2. **Provide specific, actionable information** rather than general overviews
3. **No location-based content** needed - focus on universal helpfulness

### Step 7: Content Length and Focus Execution (Brief & Helpful)
1. **Prioritize brevity and helpfulness**:
   - **Default approach**: Write as briefly as possible while being genuinely helpful
   - **Maximum length**: 1,200 words - but if you can answer it well in 600-800 words, stop there
   - **No minimum word count**: Focus on answering questions thoroughly, not hitting word targets
   - **Word count validation**: Always check final word count and edit to remove unnecessary content
2. **Question-focused content strategy**:
   - **Answer the question directly**: Start each section with a clear, immediate answer
   - **Essential information only**: What readers need to know to make decisions or understand the topic
   - **Skip unrelated facts**: Avoid medical minutiae or background that doesn't answer the specific question
   - **Conversational flow**: Write as if personally answering someone's specific question
3. **Content depth approach**:
   - **Main question plus 4-6 related sub-questions** that naturally follow from the main topic
   - **Section structure**: Each H2 should answer a specific question that readers actually ask
   - **Stop when helpful**: If the topic is thoroughly covered in fewer words, don't add padding
4. **Helpful over comprehensive**: Better to thoroughly answer key questions than partially cover many topics
5. **Reader-first approach**: Write what people need to know, not what demonstrates medical expertise

### Step 8: Research and References (Front Matter)
1. **Use references from working file** if available, otherwise search for credible sources using WebSearch to support content claims:
   - **Medical journals**: PubMed, dermatology publications, aesthetic medicine journals
   - **Regulatory sources**: FDA guidelines, approvals, and safety information
   - **Professional associations**: American Society of Dermatologic Surgery, American Academy of Dermatology, etc.
   - **Peer-reviewed research**: Clinical studies and evidence-based research
2. **Select 3-5 high-quality references** that directly relate to the treatment/topic discussed
3. **Prioritize authoritative sources** over general websites or commercial content
4. **MANDATORY: Use WebSearch to find actual URLs** - Do not create academic citations or assume URLs
5. **Add references to front matter schema** (NOT article content):
   - **Format**: YAML array with name and url fields
   - **Example**:
     ```yaml
     references:
       - name: "U.S. Food and Drug Administration - BOTOX for Chronic Migraine"
         url: "https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/botox-onabotulinumtoxina-chronic-migraine"
       - name: "Mayo Clinic - Botox Injections for Chronic Migraine"  
         url: "https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/botox/about/pac-20384658"
     ```
6. **DO NOT create references section in article body** - Hugo will render references automatically at build time after FAQs
7. **Verify URLs work** - Each URL must be real and accessible
8. **Document in working file**: Add found references with URLs for easy access during revisions
