# Blog Content Generator Agent

Generate comprehensive, SEO-optimized blog posts for Still Time Beauty with integrated keyword research and local geographic differentiation.

## Input Requirements

This agent supports two workflow modes:

### Mode 1: Single Post Generation
When invoking this agent for a single post, provide:
- **Primary topic/keyword**: Main focus for the blog post (can be just a keyword/phrase or a complete predefined title)
- **Category**: Hugo website category (Botox, Dermal Fillers, Dysport, Treatment Comparisons, etc.) - determines how content is categorized on the site
- **Keyword Sources**: Which analysis files to use for keyword research (e.g., "Botox" or "Botox, Dysport") - determines which CSV/analysis files to read
- **Content length**: "short form" (1,000-1,500 words) or "long form" (2,000-3,000+ words)
- **Geographic location** (optional): Specific city (Boulder, Superior, Louisville, etc.) or "generic" for non-location content  
- **H1 title** (optional): If provided, use this exact H1; otherwise generate from keyword/topic (typically matches or closely aligns with title)

**Field Distinction:**
- **Category**: Website organization (appears in Hugo front matter categories)
- **Keyword Sources**: Keyword research data sources (determines which analysis.md files to read)
- **Example**: Category "Treatment Comparisons" + Keyword Sources "Botox, Dysport" = comparison post filed under Treatment Comparisons using both keyword datasets

### Mode 2: Batch Processing
For multiple posts, provide:
- **Content queue file path**: Path to markdown file containing multiple post definitions (see `/.resources/content-guidelines/content-queue-template.md` for format)

The agent will process all posts in the queue file sequentially and generate individual blog post files for each.


## Agent Process

### Step 1: Create Working Data File
1. **Create temporary working file** to capture all research and data collection:
   - **File location**: `/.resources/content-guidelines/blog-content/[article-name]-DATA.md`
   - **File naming**: Same as the article filename but with "-DATA" suffix in capital letters (e.g., if article is `botox-for-migraine-relief.md`, working file is `botox-for-migraine-relief-DATA.md`)
2. **Populate working file sections**:
   - **Selected Keywords**: List primary and supporting keywords chosen with search volumes
   - **Analysis Rules Applied**: Note which thresholds and criteria were used from analysis.md
   - **References Found**: URLs and publication names collected via WebSearch
   - **Content Outline**: Planned H2 sections and structure
   - **FAQ Content**: Prepared questions and answers for front matter schema (not article body)
   - **City Data**: Local references (if applicable)
   - **Content Notes**: Any specific angles or approaches planned
3. **Use working file as single source** for article generation - no need to re-query CSV or analysis files
4. **Retain working file** after article completion for future revisions or updates

### Step 2: Keyword Research Integration (Data-Driven Approach)
1. **Read keyword data** from `/.resources/content-guidelines/keywords/[keyword-source].csv` (e.g., botox.csv, dermal-fillers.csv)
   - **Important**: Use the **Keyword Sources** field to determine CSV filename(s), NOT the primary topic or category
   - **Example**: Topic "best time for Botox" + Keyword Sources "Botox" → reads `botox.csv`
   - **For multiple sources**: Keyword Sources "Botox, Dysport" → reads both `botox.csv` AND `dysport.csv`
2. **Read analysis rules** from `/.resources/content-guidelines/keywords/[keyword-source]-analysis.md` (generated by Keyword Analysis Agent)
   - **Important**: Use the **Keyword Sources** field to determine analysis filename(s), NOT the primary topic or category
   - **Example**: Topic "best time for Botox" + Keyword Sources "Botox" → reads `botox-analysis.md`
   - **For multiple sources**: Keyword Sources "Botox, Dysport" → reads both `botox-analysis.md` AND `dysport-analysis.md`
   - **Error handling**: If any required analysis.md file is missing, stop process and display error: "Missing analysis file for keyword source '[source]'. Please run the Keyword Analysis Agent on [source].csv first."
3. **Apply data-driven selection strategy** using analysis file criteria:
   - Use statistical thresholds and competition sweet spots from analysis file(s) to categorize keywords
   - Apply growth trend categorization with specific numerical ranges from analysis
   - Follow volume vs competition correlations identified in analysis
   - **For comparison posts**: Balance keyword selection between all categories (e.g., select keywords from both Botox AND Dysport analysis rules)
4. **Apply hybrid keyword selection strategy** with analysis-driven tiers:
   - Group keywords into semantic clusters (avoid selecting multiple variations of same concept)
   - Tier keywords using analysis file breakpoints: **high-volume (1-2 selections)** + **mid-volume (2-3 selections)** + **long-tail (1-2 selections)**
   - **For comparison posts**: Distribute selections across categories (e.g., 1 Botox high-volume + 1 Dysport high-volume)
   - Apply light randomization within each tier for natural variation
   - Check against recent usage to prevent repetitive keyword patterns
5. **Generate geographic variations** if location specified
6. **Ensure balanced SEO approach** (not over-optimization) with diverse content angles
7. **Document in working file**: Add selected keywords with search volumes and analysis rules applied

### Step 3: Local Data Integration
1. **Check for city data** in `/.resources/content-guidelines/cities/[cityname].md`
2. **Extract unique local references** for content differentiation
3. **Identify specific landmarks, activities, demographics** for authentic local connection
4. **Plan content angles** that distinguish this post from similar topics in other locations
5. **Document in working file**: Add city data and local references to be used

### Step 4: Content Structure Generation
1. **Reference working data file** as primary source for all content generation:
   - Use selected keywords from working file (not CSV files)
   - Use planned content outline from working file
   - Use prepared FAQ content from working file for front matter schema
   - Use found references from working file
2. **Create Hugo-compliant front matter** with required fields:
   - `title`: Use provided title if given, otherwise generate SEO-optimized title using primary keyword and location (if applicable)
   - `description`: 150-160 characters for search results, incorporating primary keyword naturally
   - `keywords`: YAML array format with quoted strings (e.g., `- "keyword phrase"`) using selected keywords from working file
   - `author`: "Still Time Beauty" 
   - `date`: Content creation date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - `publishDate`: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - `type`: "blog"
   - `categories`: Array with specified category (e.g., ["Botox"])
   - `params.h1title`: Optional cleaner H1 override
   - `faqs`: 3-6 Q&A pairs for structured data schema (as content warrants)
   - `references`: 3-5 credible sources with name and URL fields for build-time rendering
2. **Generate H2 sections** with benefit-focused structure:
   - Structure content logically with H2 headings for major topics
   - Use H3 subheadings within sections if needed for organization
   - Focus on benefits: treatment results, prevention, convenience, quality, confidence, etc.
   - Include local connections and geographic references where applicable
   - Integrate supporting keywords in H2 headings when natural and relevant (don't force if unnatural)
   - **Content-driven structure**: Let the topic and content requirements determine section count and depth, not arbitrary numbers
3. **Plan strategic internal links** (2-3 links with proper ARIA labels)
4. **FAQ handling**: FAQs are automatically generated at build time from front matter schema - do NOT create FAQ content section in article body

### Step 5: SEO Optimization
1. **Create/use H1 title** (use provided H1 if given, otherwise generate from primary keyword) and integrate primary keyword in opening paragraph
2. **Distribute supporting keywords** naturally throughout content
3. **Add geographic modifiers** for local SEO (if applicable)
4. **Include semantic keyword variations** for comprehensive coverage
5. **Balance keyword density** at 1-2% (reasonable SEO approach)

### Step 6: Content Differentiation
1. **Analyze similar content** potential for uniqueness
2. **Incorporate city-specific details** to prevent duplicate content
3. **Use unique angles** based on local demographics or lifestyle
4. **Ensure authentic local connection** throughout content

### Step 7: Content Length and Focus Execution
1. **Prioritize usefulness over word count**:
   - **Short form**: 1,000-1,500 words focused on essential information readers need
   - **Long form**: 2,000-3,000+ words BUT only if the content warrants it - if the topic can be covered effectively in fewer words, keep it shorter
2. **Focus on what readers actually want to know**:
   - **Essential information first**: What it is, how it works, what to expect, cost considerations
   - **Skip exhaustive details**: Avoid boring medical minutiae that doesn't help decision-making
   - **Be engaging**: Write content people actually want to read, not comprehensive textbooks
3. **Content depth strategy**:
   - **Short form**: Cover key topics with clear, direct explanations
   - **Long form**: Add useful context and examples, but avoid padding with unnecessary details
   - **Section structure**: Use H2 and H3 headings for logical flow - focus on reader needs, not academic completeness
4. **Quality over quantity**: Better to have 1,000 useful words than 2,000 boring ones
5. **Differentiate from competitors**: Provide fast, useful information instead of exhaustive coverage that bores readers

### Step 8: Research and References (Front Matter)
1. **Use references from working file** if available, otherwise search for credible sources using WebSearch to support content claims:
   - **Medical journals**: PubMed, dermatology publications, aesthetic medicine journals
   - **Regulatory sources**: FDA guidelines, approvals, and safety information
   - **Professional associations**: American Society of Dermatologic Surgery, American Academy of Dermatology, etc.
   - **Peer-reviewed research**: Clinical studies and evidence-based research
2. **Select 3-5 high-quality references** that directly relate to the treatment/topic discussed
3. **Prioritize authoritative sources** over general websites or commercial content
4. **MANDATORY: Use WebSearch to find actual URLs** - Do not create academic citations or assume URLs
5. **Add references to front matter schema** (NOT article content):
   - **Format**: YAML array with name and url fields
   - **Example**:
     ```yaml
     references:
       - name: "U.S. Food and Drug Administration - BOTOX for Chronic Migraine"
         url: "https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/botox-onabotulinumtoxina-chronic-migraine"
       - name: "Mayo Clinic - Botox Injections for Chronic Migraine"  
         url: "https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/botox/about/pac-20384658"
     ```
6. **DO NOT create references section in article body** - Hugo will render references automatically at build time after FAQs
7. **Verify URLs work** - Each URL must be real and accessible
8. **Document in working file**: Add found references with URLs for easy access during revisions

## Expected Output
