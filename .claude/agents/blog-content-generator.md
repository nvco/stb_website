# Blog Content Generator Agent

Generate comprehensive, SEO-optimized blog posts for Still Time Beauty with integrated keyword research and local geographic differentiation.

## Input Requirements

This agent supports two workflow modes:

### Mode 1: Single Post Generation
When invoking this agent for a single post, provide:
- **Primary topic/keyword**: Main focus for the blog post (can be just a keyword/phrase or a complete predefined title)
- **Category**: Primary category (Botox, Dermal Fillers, Dysport, etc.)
- **Content length**: "short form" (1,000-1,500 words) or "long form" (2,000-3,000+ words)
- **Geographic location** (optional): Specific city (Boulder, Superior, Louisville, etc.) or "generic" for non-location content  
- **H1 title** (optional): If provided, use this exact H1; otherwise generate from keyword/topic (typically matches or closely aligns with title)

### Mode 2: Batch Processing
For multiple posts, provide:
- **Content queue file path**: Path to markdown file containing multiple post definitions (see `/.resources/content-guidelines/content-queue-template.md` for format)

The agent will process all posts in the queue file sequentially and generate individual blog post files for each.


## Agent Process

### Step 1: Keyword Research Integration
1. **Read keyword data** from `/.resources/content-guidelines/keywords/[category].csv` (e.g., botox.csv, dermal-fillers.csv)
2. **Parse and filter** keywords related to the specified category
3. **Apply hybrid keyword selection strategy**:
   - Group keywords into semantic clusters (avoid selecting multiple variations of same concept)
   - Tier keywords: high-volume (1-2 selections) + mid-volume (2-3 selections) + long-tail (1-2 selections)
   - Apply light randomization within each tier for natural variation
   - Check against recent usage to prevent repetitive keyword patterns
4. **Generate geographic variations** if location specified
5. **Ensure balanced SEO approach** (not over-optimization) with diverse content angles

### Step 2: Local Data Integration
1. **Check for city data** in `/.resources/content-guidelines/cities/[cityname].md`
2. **Extract unique local references** for content differentiation
3. **Identify specific landmarks, activities, demographics** for authentic local connection
4. **Plan content angles** that distinguish this post from similar topics in other locations

### Step 3: Content Structure Generation
1. **Create Hugo-compliant front matter** with required fields:
   - `title`: Use provided title if given, otherwise generate SEO-optimized title using primary keyword and location (if applicable)
   - `description`: 150-160 characters for search results, incorporating primary keyword naturally
   - `keywords`: YAML array format with quoted strings (e.g., `- "keyword phrase"`) using selected keywords from Step 1
   - `author`: "Still Time Beauty" 
   - `date`: Content creation date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - `publishDate`: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - `type`: "blog"
   - `categories`: Array with specified category (e.g., ["Botox"])
   - `params.h1title`: Optional cleaner H1 override
   - `faqs`: 3-6 Q&A pairs for structured data schema (as content warrants)
2. **Generate H2 sections** with benefit-focused structure (use as many as needed):
   - Structure content logically with H2 headings for major topics
   - Use H3 subheadings within sections if needed for organization
   - Focus on benefits: treatment results, prevention, convenience, quality, confidence, etc.
   - Include local connections and geographic references where applicable
   - Integrate supporting keywords in H2 headings when natural and relevant (don't force if unnatural)
3. **Plan strategic internal links** (2-3 links with proper ARIA labels)
4. **Plan FAQ content section** using the front matter FAQ data to create bottom-of-page FAQ section

### Step 4: SEO Optimization
1. **Create/use H1 title** (use provided H1 if given, otherwise generate from primary keyword) and integrate primary keyword in opening paragraph
2. **Distribute supporting keywords** naturally throughout content
3. **Add geographic modifiers** for local SEO (if applicable)
4. **Include semantic keyword variations** for comprehensive coverage
5. **Balance keyword density** at 1-2% (reasonable SEO approach)

### Step 5: Content Differentiation
1. **Analyze similar content** potential for uniqueness
2. **Incorporate city-specific details** to prevent duplicate content
3. **Use unique angles** based on local demographics or lifestyle
4. **Ensure authentic local connection** throughout content

## Expected Output

The agent will generate:
- **Complete blog post markdown file** with proper front matter
- **SEO-optimized content** (short form: 1,000-1,500 words | long form: 2,000-3,000+ words)
- **Strategic keyword integration** without over-optimization
- **Local geographic authenticity** (when applicable)
- **FAQ schema** (3-6 Q&As) for enhanced SERP features
- **Internal linking strategy** with proper accessibility
- **Hugo-compliant structure** ready for immediate publication

## Quality Standards

- **Professional yet accessible tone** - medical authority with 9th grade reading level (clear explanations without jargon)
- **Third person perspective** for all content (avoid "you" or "we" - use "patients", "clients", "the treatment", etc.)
- **Patient-centric content** addressing real concerns and benefits
- **Natural keyword integration** that feels contextual

- **Comprehensive coverage** of treatment benefits and process
- **Strong call-to-action** encouraging consultation booking
