# Keyword Strategy Agent

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Strategic Scoring System
- **Quick Win Score**: `(Volume × Trend Growth × Local Relevance) ÷ Competition²`
- **Authority Score**: `Volume × Commercial Intent × Topic Cluster Strength`
- **Balance Score**: Weighted combination preventing over-optimization for easy targets

### 2. Pyramid Progression Strategy
- **Foundation Phase (30%)**: Low competition, decent volume - establish domain authority
- **Growth Phase (50%)**: Medium competition, good volume - build momentum  
- **Authority Phase (20%)**: High competition, high volume - target premium terms

### 3. Content Clustering Logic
- Groups semantically related keywords into topic clusters
- Identifies supporting content opportunities (long-tail variations)
- Plans content sequences for topical authority building

### 4. Seasonal & Trend Analysis
- Prioritizes keywords showing growth momentum
- Considers seasonal patterns for content calendar planning
- Identifies emerging opportunities before competition increases

## Input Requirements

### Required Files
- **CSV Files**: `/.resources/content-guidelines/keywords/[category].csv` (directly in keywords folder)

### CSV Structure Expected
- Keyword/keyphrase
- Average monthly searches
- 3-month change (%)
- Year-over-year change (%)  
- Competition (low/medium/high)
- Competition indexed value (0-100)
- Top of page bid ranges

### Strategic Prioritization Workflow
- Reads existing analysis files generated by Keyword Analysis Agent
- Uses statistical thresholds and breakpoints for strategic prioritization decisions  
- Creates priority batches organized into Foundation/Growth/Authority phases
- Focused on strategic planning and batch organization for optimal SEO progression

## Agent Process

### Step 1: Read Analysis Data
1. **Read CSV file** to load raw keyword data
2. **Read corresponding analysis file** from `/.resources/content-guidelines/keywords/analysis/[category]-analysis.md`
3. **Extract statistical thresholds** and breakpoints from analysis:
   - Volume tier definitions (high/medium/low thresholds)
   - Competition sweet spots and value opportunities  
   - Growth trend classifications and momentum indicators
   - Selection strategy rules and criteria
4. **Validate data consistency** between CSV and analysis files

### Step 2: Strategic Scoring and Prioritization
1. **Apply Quick Win Score** and **Authority Score** calculations using analysis criteria
2. **Categorize keywords** into Foundation/Growth/Authority phases based on analysis breakpoints
3. **Balance distribution** to achieve 30/50/20 strategic mix
4. **Create mixed batches** of 10 keywords with strategic variety per analysis recommendations

### Step 3: Generate Priority Batches
1. **Create batch files** with strategic keyword ordering
2. **Organize into manageable files** (50 keywords per batch file)
3. **Add progress tracking** with markdown checkboxes
4. **Save batch files** to `/.resources/content-guidelines/content-todo/[category]/`

## Output Format

### Output Location

**Priority Batches:**
- **Folder Structure**: `/.resources/content-guidelines/content-todo/[category]/`
- **File Organization**: `batch-01.md`, `batch-02.md`, etc. (50 keywords per file)
- **Universal Guide**: `README.md` in content-todo folder explains all metrics

**Required Input Files:**
- **CSV Data**: `/.resources/content-guidelines/keywords/[category].csv`
- **Analysis File**: `/.resources/content-guidelines/keywords/analysis/[category]-analysis.md` (generated by Keyword Analysis Agent)

### Progress Tracking Features
- **Markdown Checkboxes**: Each keyword has `- [ ]` for easy progress tracking
- **Batch Organization**: 5 batches of 10 keywords per file for manageable execution
- **Usage**: Check off `- [x]` as content is created and published

### 1. Batch File Format
```markdown
# [Category] Content - Batch X (Keywords Y-Z)

## Batch 1: Keywords 1-10
**Strategic Mix**: [X] Foundation + [Y] Growth + [Z] Authority

- [ ] **[keyword]** | Volume: [number] | Competition: [level] | Score: [score] | **[Foundation]**
- [ ] **[keyword]** | Volume: [number] | Competition: [level] | Score: [score] | **[Growth]**
- [ ] **[keyword]** | Volume: [number] | Competition: [level] | Score: [score] | **[Authority]**
[Continue for 10 keywords...]

## Batch 2: Keywords 11-20
**Strategic Mix**: [X] Foundation + [Y] Growth + [Z] Authority

[Continue for 10 more keywords...]

[Repeat for Batches 3, 4, and 5 - total of 50 keywords per file]
```

### 2. File Organization Strategy
- **50 Keywords per File**: Manageable size for execution (5 batches of 10)
- **Progressive Strategy**: Later batches shift toward Growth and Authority content
- **Batch Numbering**: batch-01.md, batch-02.md, batch-03.md, etc.
- **Category Folders**: Each keyword category gets its own subfolder

## Scoring Algorithm Details

### Quick Win Score Calculation
```
Score = (Monthly Volume × Growth Multiplier × Local Bonus) ÷ (Competition Index²)

Where:
- Growth Multiplier: 1.0 + (3-month % change ÷ 100)
- Local Bonus: 1.2 if includes local terms, 1.0 otherwise
- Competition Index: 0-100 value from CSV
```

### Authority Score Calculation  
```
Score = Monthly Volume × Commercial Intent × Cluster Strength

Where:
- Commercial Intent: 1.5 for buying keywords, 1.2 for service keywords, 1.0 for info
- Cluster Strength: 1.0 + (related keywords in dataset ÷ 10)
```

### Balance Algorithm
- Prevents over-optimization for only easy targets
- Ensures 30/50/20 distribution across difficulty phases
- Considers content calendar spacing and topical diversity
