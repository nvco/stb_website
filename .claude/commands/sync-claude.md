Please perform a comprehensive sync with changes made by Cursor:

1. Read and analyze the current CONTEXT.md file to understand any updates since our last session

2. Read all files in the context/ folder (development-history.md, etc.) to check for new entries or changes

3. Scan the codebase for any significant changes that might affect project patterns, architecture, or conventions

4. Compare the current state with what's documented in CLAUDE.md

5. If you find important updates that should be reflected in CLAUDE.md (new patterns, architectural decisions, conventions, or project changes), update CLAUDE.md accordingly

6. Only update CLAUDE.md if there are genuinely significant changes that would help me work more effectively on this project

Focus on changes that affect how I should approach coding in this project, not just feature completions or minor updates.
