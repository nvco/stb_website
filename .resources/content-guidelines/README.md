# Content Guidelines Directory

This directory contains resources for the Blog Content Generator agent to create unique, locally-relevant content.

## Structure

### `/cities/`
Contains local data files for geographic content differentiation:
- `superior.md` - Superior, Colorado local data
- `boulder.md` - Boulder, Colorado local data
- *Add additional city files as needed*

### `keywords.csv` (User-provided)
CSV file containing keyword research data with columns:
- Keyword/phrase
- Search volume  
- Any additional data columns

## Usage

The Blog Content Generator agent uses these files to:

1. **Extract relevant keywords** from the CSV based on treatment focus
2. **Integrate local data** from city files for geographic differentiation  
3. **Create unique content angles** that distinguish similar topics across locations
4. **Generate authentic local references** for each geographic area

## Adding New Cities

To add a new city:

1. **Create city file**: `/cities/[cityname].md`
2. **Include standard sections**:
   - Basic Information (population, demographics, location)
   - Key Landmarks & Local References
   - Lifestyle & Demographics  
   - Content Angles for Differentiation
   - Unique City Characteristics
   - Content Integration Examples
   - SEO Geographic Modifiers

3. **Focus on differentiation**: What makes this city unique for content creation?

## Content Differentiation Strategy

Each city file should provide:
- **Specific landmarks** and locations to reference
- **Demographic insights** that influence treatment appeal
- **Lifestyle characteristics** that connect to aesthetic treatments
- **Local culture elements** that create authentic connection
- **Unique angles** that distinguish content from other cities

This ensures every blog post feels authentically connected to its target geographic area while maintaining SEO value and professional quality.
