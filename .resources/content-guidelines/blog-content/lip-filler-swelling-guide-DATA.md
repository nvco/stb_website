faqs:
  - question: "How long does lip filler swelling last?"
    answer: "Lip filler swelling typically peaks within 24-48 hours after treatment and gradually subsides over 7-14 days. Most patients see significant improvement by day 3-4, with final results visible after two weeks. Individual healing varies based on factors like filler type, injection technique, and personal healing response."
  - question: "What can I do to reduce lip filler swelling?"
    answer: "To minimize swelling, apply ice for 10-15 minutes several times during the first 24 hours. Sleep with the head elevated, avoid strenuous exercise for 48 hours, and stay hydrated. Avoid blood-thinning medications unless prescribed by a physician, and use gentle skincare products during healing."
  - question: "Is it normal for lip filler swelling to be uneven?"
    answer: "Yes, uneven swelling is completely normal during the first week after lip filler treatment. Lips naturally heal at different rates, and initial asymmetry typically resolves as swelling subsides. If significant unevenness persists after two weeks, contact the treating provider for evaluation."
  - question: "When should I worry about lip filler swelling?"
    answer: "Contact the provider immediately if swelling is accompanied by severe pain, extreme asymmetry, skin discoloration (white, blue, or gray areas), signs of infection (fever, pus), or if swelling worsens significantly after the first 48 hours. These may indicate complications requiring immediate attention."
  - question: "Can I wear makeup over swollen lips after filler?"
    answer: "Wait at least 24 hours before applying makeup to treated lips to reduce infection risk. When ready, use clean brushes and gentle products. Avoid matte lipsticks that may emphasize texture irregularities during healing, opting instead for hydrating lip products."
  - question: "Where can I get lip fillers near Boulder, Colorado?"
    answer: "Boulder, Colorado residents can access expert lip filler treatments at Still Time Beauty - conveniently located to serve Boulder and surrounding communities including Superior, Louisville, and Lafayette. With Boulder's health-conscious culture and active lifestyle, patients appreciate natural-looking results that complement their outdoor recreation and professional activities."
