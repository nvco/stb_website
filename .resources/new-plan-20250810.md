# Hugo Migration

I wanna migrate this static site to Hugo, https://gohugo.io. 

Break up the plan below into reasonable chunks and create a task list that we can follow through. Preferably create a markdown file where you can keep track of the tasks to do and what you completed already. 

I move the existing site to `original-site-backup` folder, Including the CLAUDE.md file as I was not sure if we were going to create a new one or not. 

Before starting, let's discuss if we should create the CLAUDE.md file first, so you can update it continuously, or later when you have all the info to update it with. 

In this  `original-site-backup` folder You can find Claude.md and also Context.md and all the Markdown files in the `context` folder with all the details about the site. 

I want to have 5 different content types or layouts. I'm not sure about the correct wording yet, so let's talk about this before starting the project. 

1. Landing pages like: home, about, services
2. Utility: cancellation-policy, pre-post-treatment
3. Legal: privacy-policy, terms-of-service, hipaa-notice, medical-disclaimers
4. Content(blog posts): benefits-botox-superior-colorado-youthful-appearance
5. List page(blog post list page): blog

Pay attention to what each page has in the header and what specific differences they have because we are on a reserve that is set up for Hugo. 

Keep the design as is and don't change the copy. 

Follow `.cursor/rules` for coding standards. 

Reorganize everything because we have headers and includes. Reorganize them according to how Hugo does all this. 

Ask me questions if I missed anything or if I wasn't clear on something.
