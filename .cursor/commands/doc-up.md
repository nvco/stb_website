# Documentation Update Before Commit Workflow

Please follow this workflow to prepare changes for commit:

1. Execute documentation updates based on the changes:
   - Significant changes → Update CONTEXT.md or appropriate files in the context/ folder
   - Feature completions or development milestones → Update development-history.md  
   - Minor fixes or implementation details → Maybe update neither

2. Execute CLAUDE.md review and include any relevant updates in CONTEXT.md or other files in the context/ folder

Walk through each step and let me know what you find before proceeding to the next step.
