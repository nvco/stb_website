# Documentation Update Before Commit Workflow

Follow this workflow to prepare documentation changes:

1. Analyze the changes and propose documentation updates:
   - Significant changes → Propose updates to CONTEXT.md or appropriate files in the context/ folder
   - Feature completions or development milestones → Propose updates to development-history.md  
   - Minor fixes or implementation details → Maybe update neither

2. Check if CLAUDE.md has any useful information that should be added to CONTEXT.md or context/ folder files

3. Show me exactly what you want to change and ask for my approval. Once approved, execute the changes.
