# Tailwind CSS Rules

## Core Principles
- Always use utility-first approach - build components by combining small, single-purpose utility classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design - start with base styles, then add responsive prefixes (md:, lg:, xl:)
- Prefer Tailwind utilities over custom CSS whenever possible
- Use semantic class grouping - group related utilities logically in class lists
- Avoid arbitrary values unless absolutely necessary - stick to design system values

## Responsive Design
- Start with mobile styles (no prefix), then enhance for larger screens using md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl:
- Use responsive prefixes for layout changes, typography scaling, and spacing adjustments
- Apply responsive utilities to every screen size consideration
- Remember Tailwind uses min-width media queries (mobile-first)

## Layout & Spacing
- Use consistent spacing scale values: 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24 for major spacing
- Prefer space-y-* and space-x-* utilities for consistent gaps between elements
- Use container mx-auto pattern for centered layouts
- Apply max-width constraints to text content for readability (max-w-prose, max-w-2xl)
- Use flex and grid utilities for modern layouts

## Interactive States
- Always include hover states for interactive elements, but remember hover doesn't exist on touch devices
- Use focus states for accessibility (focus:ring-2, focus:outline-none) 
- Combine states when needed (hover:bg-blue-600 focus:bg-blue-600)
- Apply appropriate cursor utilities (cursor-pointer, cursor-not-allowed, cursor-wait) - note these only affect desktop/mouse users
- Use group utilities for parent-child hover interactions
- Consider touch-friendly sizing: minimum 44px (touch-44) for tap targets on mobile
- Use active states (active:bg-blue-700) for immediate feedback on touch devices
- Avoid hover-only interactions - ensure touch users can access all functionality
- **Button text centering**: Always include `justify-center` class for proper mobile button text alignment
- **Consistent focus indicators**: Use `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-emerald-500 focus:outline-none` for consistent focus styling
- **Mobile menu states**: Implement proper `aria-expanded` toggling with corresponding visual states

## Colors & Design System
- Stick to defined color scales (blue-500, gray-200, etc.) rather than arbitrary colors
- Use semantic color choices (green for success, red for errors, blue for primary actions)
- Apply opacity using slash syntax (bg-black/50, text-white/80) instead of separate opacity utilities
- Maintain consistent color usage across similar elements

## Typography
- Use responsive text sizing (text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl)
- Apply appropriate line heights (leading-relaxed for body text, leading-tight for headings)
- Use font weight meaningfully (font-semibold for emphasis, font-bold for strong hierarchy)
- Ensure proper text color contrast for accessibility

## Component Patterns
- Extract repeated utility combinations into components when you use the same pattern 3+ times
- Use @apply directive sparingly - only for complex repeated patterns
- Prefer composition over extraction when possible
- Name component classes semantically (btn-primary, card-elevated)
- **Button component patterns**: Always include `justify-center` and proper focus states for consistent button behavior
- **Mobile menu patterns**: Use consistent `aria-expanded` state styling with `hidden` and `block` utilities
- **Icon-text combinations**: Create reusable patterns for icons with text using consistent spacing
- **Card components**: Implement consistent shadow, padding, and hover state patterns for content cards

## Performance & Optimization
- Only include utilities that are actually used in your markup
- Use JIT mode for optimal bundle size
- Avoid deeply nested arbitrary values
- Prefer standard utilities over custom CSS properties
- Reference Tailwind documentation for component patterns rather than reinventing common solutions
- **System fonts strategy**: Use Tailwind's system font stacks (font-serif, font-sans) to eliminate web font loading
- **Reduce layout shift**: Always specify image dimensions and use proper aspect ratio utilities
- **Critical CSS**: Load Tailwind CSS synchronously in the head to prevent FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)
- **Font loading optimization**: Eliminate Google Fonts dependency for faster LCP and zero external font requests

## Accessibility (CSS-focused)
- Always include focus states and proper focus management - use focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:outline-none
- Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios - avoid light text on light backgrounds
- Include sr-only utilities for screen reader content when needed (sr-only class)
- Ensure touch targets are minimum 44px (w-11 h-11 or larger) for mobile accessibility
- Avoid hover-dependent functionality that excludes touch users
- Provide visual focus indicators that are clearly visible (avoid focus:outline-none without replacement)
- Ensure interactive elements have proper contrast in all states (hover, focus, active, disabled)
- Use text-* utilities to maintain readable font sizes (minimum 16px/text-base on mobile)
- Avoid using color alone to convey information - combine with icons, text, or patterns
- **Skip link styling**: Hide skip links with `sr-only` until focused, then show with proper positioning
- **Mobile menu focus**: Use enhanced focus indicators with background highlights for menu items
- **Scroll target focus**: Apply temporary focus styling to scroll destination elements
- **Motion preferences**: Use `motion-reduce:` prefix to respect users' motion preferences
- **Focus restoration**: Ensure focus returns to logical elements after modal/menu interactions

## Custom CSS with Tailwind
- **When to write custom CSS**: Only when Tailwind utilities cannot achieve the desired result
- **Use @layer directive**: Organize custom CSS into @layer base, @layer components, @layer utilities
- **Prefer Tailwind patterns**: Follow Tailwind's design token system even in custom CSS
- **Use @apply sparingly**: Only for complex repeated utility combinations, not simple ones
- **CSS custom properties**: Use CSS variables for theme variations rather than complex overrides
- **Component-scoped styles**: Keep component-specific CSS close to the component when possible
- **File organization**: Keep custom CSS files small and focused (under 300 lines per file)
- **Modular structure**: Separate custom CSS into logical modules (components, base, utilities)
- **Naming conventions**: Use descriptive class names that explain purpose, not appearance
- **Performance**: Minimize custom CSS file sizes and remove unused styles regularly
