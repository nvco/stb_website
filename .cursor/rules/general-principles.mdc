# General Development Principles

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Simplicity
- Write simple and straightforward code that accomplishes the task effectively
- Choose the most direct solution over complex abstractions when possible
- Avoid over-engineering - implement what is needed, not what might be needed
- Prefer clear, obvious implementations over clever or obscure ones

### 2. Readability
- Ensure your code is easy to read and understand by other developers
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes that explain their purpose
- Structure code with proper indentation, spacing, and logical organization
- Write code that tells a clear story of what it does and why

### 3. Performance
- Keep performance considerations in mind during development
- Do not over-optimize at the cost of readability and maintainability
- Profile and measure before optimizing - avoid premature optimization
- Focus on algorithmic efficiency over micro-optimizations

### 4. Maintainability
- Write code that is easy to maintain, update, and extend over time
- Use consistent patterns and conventions throughout the codebase
- Structure code to minimize the impact of future changes
- Document complex logic and business rules clearly

### 5. Testability
- Ensure your code is easy to test with unit tests and integration tests
- Write functions and components that can be tested in isolation
- Avoid hard dependencies and global state that make testing difficult
- Structure code to allow for easy mocking and stubbing of dependencies

### 6. Reusability
- Write reusable components, functions, and modules when appropriate
- Create abstractions that can be used across different parts of the application
- Design interfaces that are flexible and can accommodate different use cases
- Balance reusability with simplicity - don't over-abstract

### 7. Correct and DRY Code
- Focus on writing correct code that follows established best practices
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle - avoid code duplication
- Ensure code handles edge cases and error conditions appropriately
- Use established patterns and conventions for the language and framework

### 8. Function and Code Documentation
- Add a comment at the start of each function describing what it does
- Document the purpose, parameters, return values, and any side effects
- Explain complex algorithms, business logic, or non-obvious implementations
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

### 9. Accurate Dating in Documentation
- Always use the current actual date (month/year) when updating development history or documentation
- Check terminal output or system date if uncertain about the current date
- Development milestones should reflect when work was actually performed
- Maintain accurate project timeline for future reference and coordination

### 10. Server Error Debugging - Critical Pattern Recognition
- **Universal 500 errors in a specific directory = .htaccess rewrite rule problem**
- If EVERY file in a directory gives 500 errors regardless of content, the issue is NOT the PHP code
- **Most common cause: Infinite rewrite loop in .htaccess rules**
- **Fix: Add RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f and !-d before problematic RewriteRule**
- Don't waste time creating test files or checking PHP syntax when the pattern clearly indicates rewrite issues
- **Remember: Content-agnostic 500 errors = server configuration problem, not code problem**

## Code Modification Guidelines

### Surgical Code Changes
- **Only modify sections of the code related to the task at hand**
- **Avoid modifying unrelated pieces of code** unless specifically required
- **Avoid changing existing comments** unless they are incorrect or outdated
- **Avoid any kind of cleanup unless specifically instructed to do so**
- **Accomplish the goal with the minimum amount of code changes necessary**

### Change Management Best Practices
- Focus changes on the specific feature or bug being addressed
- Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly asked to change it
- Maintain the existing code style and patterns unless they conflict with requirements
- Test that changes don't break existing functionality
- Make changes that are easy to review and understand

### When Making Changes
- Understand the existing code before making modifications
- Respect the current architecture and design patterns
- Add new code that fits naturally with the existing codebase
- Avoid refactoring unless it's necessary for the current task
- Document any significant changes or new functionality

## Code Quality Standards

### Consistency
- Follow the established coding standards and conventions in the project
- Use the same patterns and approaches as the existing codebase
- Maintain consistent naming conventions, formatting, and structure
- Align with team coding standards and style guides

### Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling for all failure scenarios
- Provide meaningful error messages that help with debugging
- Handle edge cases and unexpected inputs gracefully
- Use appropriate error handling patterns for the language and framework

### Security Considerations
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Follow security best practices for the language and framework
- Avoid common security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, etc.)
- Use secure coding practices for authentication and authorization

### Code Review Readiness
- Write code that is easy to review and understand
- Make changes that are focused and have a clear purpose
- Provide clear commit messages that explain the changes
- Ensure code passes all tests and quality checks before review
