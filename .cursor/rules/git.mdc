# Git Rules

Rules for git workflows and version control in this project.

## Doc Update Before Commit

Before committing code (whether developed in Cursor or Claude Code), use the `/sync-cursor` command to ensure proper documentation updates and coordination between tools.

This workflow ensures that significant changes and insights from Claude Code sessions are properly captured in our project documentation.
